  <p>Hi there. I&rsquo;m Anjith Sasindran. An android and web developer living and working in Bangalore.
I love programming, gaming, reading about computers and I&rsquo;m a bit of a gadget freak. I also
can type pretty fast ðŸ¤·. I&rsquo;m currently developing 225Fit and was previously at Grab and
before BookMyShow. I play and watch football, enjoys working out and often times read books.</p>
<p>I would like to keep most of my blog posts simple and short and straight to the point. So why
write a blog?</p>
<ul>
<li>I sometimes have ideas which I would like to jot down somewhere</li>
<li>I might have worked on some interesting projects which I would like to share</li>
<li>Or I would like to share my general views on some specific topics (mostly programming related)</li>
